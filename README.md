## Getting Started

This section shows you how to set up and run this project on your machine. The project was developed and test with Node.js `v14.1.0` and npm `v6.14.4`. These are the only software dependencies therefore please ensure you got them installed on your system prior to the setup.

### Create Database

First let us create the SQLite database on the machine. To achieve this we must run all migrations in order to create a database which is compatible to the current entity models. This can be done by executing following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd server

npm run migrations
```

**Note:** The default location of the database will be dynamically determined based on the value set for the `APPDATA` enviroment variable which should be specified per default in the [process.env](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v11.x/api/process.html#process_process_env). The default path for the database will therefore look someting l√Æke this on Windows: `%APPDATA%/security-blog/db/security-blog.db`. If you should encounter any issue due to this, you could simply set the variable `APP_DATA_DIR` in [config.dev.env](/server/config.dev.env) to an absolute path on your machine, were file write operations aren't restricted.
